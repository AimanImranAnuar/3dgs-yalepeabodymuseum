# 3D Gaussian Splatting at the Yale Peabody Museum
This repository is set up to collect all information related to my research on 3D Gaussian Splatting. It contains our code for the installation on our virtual machine, links to datasets we've taken and/or used for our testing of 3DGS on PostShot and SuGaR, and instructions for the SuGaR pipeline.

See this Google Doc for simplified instructions on the 3DGS pipeline:
